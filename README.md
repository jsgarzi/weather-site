# weather-site

This is a weather tracking site that will use multiple API calls from oneweather to recieve both current and forecasted weather. It reports on the dates, temp, condition, humidity, wind speed, and UVI. Any locations searched will be stored locally. New Brunswick is the default location. The site prevents inputs that don't recieve responses from the server from being pushed to the search history, user can click or press enter, etc. 

Getting a grasp of some of the front end javascript was slighlty challenging, but with time it was worked through. Styling and responsiveness need improvement.
